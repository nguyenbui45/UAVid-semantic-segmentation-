# UAVid-semantic-segmentation-

In this project, I use DeeplabV3+ model with backbone ResNet50 to build up a semantic segmantation application with UAVid dataset.
This project is written by Python and Keras library, refer to an article on Keras tutorial page, you can check this article at here: https://keras.io/examples/vision/deeplabv3_plus/
